# The Global Kill List (Non-Negotiable)

These are never allowed in a 1-week game:

- ❌ Save / load systems  
- ❌ Settings menus  
- ❌ Options for controls, audio, graphics  
- ❌ Cutscenes (even short ones)  
- ❌ Dialogue trees  
- ❌ Tutorials (the game teaches itself or it doesn’t exist)  
- ❌ Procedural art generation  
- ❌ Complex shaders  
- ❌ More than one input scheme  
- ❌ “Just one more mechanic”  

If it requires a menu, it dies.

## The One-Mechanic Rule

Each game may have:

- ✅ One core mechanic  
- ✅ One modifier (speed up, more enemies, shorter timer)  

If a feature doesn’t directly support the core mechanic → kill it.

## Time-Based Kill Switches

Hard rules you enforce on yourself:

- ⏱ Day 2: If movement doesn’t feel OK → simplify it  
- ⏱ Day 3: If UI is annoying → remove UI, keep score only  
- ⏱ Day 4: If enemy AI feels wrong → make enemies dumber  
- ⏱ Day 5: No new features allowed  
- ⏱ Day 6: Only bug fixes and feel tweaks  
- ⏱ Day 7: Package, upload, done  

No exceptions.

## “This Is a Trap” Feature Kill List

Instant red flags. Kill on sight:

- “It would be cool if…”  
- “Players might want…”  
- “I should future-proof this”  
- “This could scale later”  
- “I’ll just make it data-driven now”  

These are post-week ideas, not current ones.

## Emergency Scope Reduction (When You’re Behind)

Pick two and cut them immediately:

- Remove sound effects  
- Remove animations  
- Reduce enemy types to one  
- Reduce levels to one screen  
- Replace AI with movement patterns  
- Remove progression  

If you’re still behind, remove half the game.

---

## The Finishing Rule (Most Important)

A game is done when:

- It starts  
- You can play  
- You can lose  
- You can restart  

That’s it.

No polish badge. No shame.
